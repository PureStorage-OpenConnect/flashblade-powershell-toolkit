Improvements
Added the property total to the Clients Performance response.
Added the parameter destroy_snapshots to the function update_policies. This parameter must be set to true in order to remove rules that have snapshots created. Setting this parameter to true is an acknowledgement that some of the snapshots managed by this policy will be destroyed.
